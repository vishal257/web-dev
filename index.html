    </p>
    <p>
        Building projects and solving real world problems is inarguably one of the best ways you can 
        learn how to code. Theoretical is all good, but without applying the knowledge you learn, you 
        will most likely not progress. We've made a list of 8 websites that can help you get better at 
        frontend development through practice.

                </p>
                Codewell challenges include:

                    This one is specific to CSS, but its gamification system is a great way to track 
                    your progress and continue learning, they even give away some merchandise at the 
                    end of some battles, which is always a great motivator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The battles on there aren't necessarily going to tell you how to create web layouts,
                     but they will definitely help you tackle some of the more intermediate CSS 
                     properties.

                    The great thing about CodePen challenges is that they provide prompts for nearly a
                    variety of languages and technologies. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flutter, you name 
                    it. What's even better is that you get to share your solutions with everyone who's 
                    participated in the challenges, give, and receive feedback on your solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may not be a structured way to learn, but looking at other people's code is a 
                    great way to get inspired and perhaps learn something you may have not known.
